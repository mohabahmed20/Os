#CPU scheduling algorithms for SJF and RR
This project contian java implementation of 2 CPU scheduling for SJF and RR

## SJF 
is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.
